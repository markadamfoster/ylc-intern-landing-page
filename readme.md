# Intro

A landing page for the Young Life College Intern Experience project.

## Development

There is no fancy build process or frameworks, just HTML, CSS, and a small JS library. For development, serve it up using any simple HTTP server. I used live-server during the initial build:

`live-server`

## Deployment

It is hosted (for free) with surge.sh. Domain name info is in the CNAME file. To deploy changes:

`surge`
